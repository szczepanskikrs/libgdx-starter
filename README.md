# libgdx-starter
Libgdx starter project with Kotlin and Kotlin build script DSL support.

As of current libgdx version (1.9.12) doesn't properly support Kotlin and Kotlin DSL gradle projects this project starter can be used to quickly start a new project.

If you want to use this starter please don't forget to change `version` and `groupId` in `App.kt` under `buildSrc` module and add your custom packages since example classes are to be found in `root` package.
